# Robotic-Arm
A Simple Robotic arm built with the use arduino and other hardwares
This Arduino Robotic Arm can be controlled by four Potentiometer attached to it, each potentiometer is used to control each servo. You can move these servos by rotating the pots to pick some object, with some practice you can easily pick and move the object from one place to another. We have used low torque servos here but you can use more powerful servos to pick heavy objects.
Components Required - Arduino Uno, 1000uF Capacitor (4 pieces), 100nF Capacitor (4 pieces), Servo Motor (SG 90- four pieces), 10K pot- Variable Resistor (4 pieces), Power Supply (5v- preferably two)
Servo Motor - First we talk a bit about Servo Motors. Servo Motors are mainly used when there is a need for accurate shaft movement or position. These are not proposed for high speed applications. Servo motors are proposed for low speed, medium torque and accurate position application.  So these motors are best for designing robotic arm.Servo motors are available at different shapes and sizes. We are going to use small servo motors, here we use four SG90 servos. A servo motor will have mainly there wires, one is for positive voltage another is for ground and last one is for position setting. The RED wire is connected to power, Black wire is connected to ground and YELLOW wire is connected to signal.
